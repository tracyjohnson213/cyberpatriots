[ ] link for Learn should match in context to title What is cybersecurity
[ ] student cards should use differnt color than purple; not good contrast to green - maybe use shade from footer
[ ] header logo not placed appealingly to navbar
[ ] back to top button should be centered so that it is easier to find
[ ] quick links should be removed; duplicates effort of back to top button
[ ] event table should be more consistent in color; maybe use 2 shades of green
[ ] card image should be taller to be viewed as less compact on mobile; too much space after text
[ ] increase width of video on large screen
[ ] use two columns for news on large screen
[ ] school logo in footer should have transparent background
[ ] compress images
[ ] check load speed
[ ] make font size within News text consistent for all viewports
